# JavaScriptStarterKit

Welcome to your first JavaScript project!

As it stands, this is a setup to write Javascript functions, but nothing is setup to displayl in the browser yet.

## Writing Code with ES6
[ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) makes life easier! 
This is set up so you can use ES6 syntax by default. (Look into [babel](https://babeljs.io/) if you want to see why/how!
Right now, just know that that means you can use pretty much anything that you find on StackOverflow!

## Testing
You can run your tests with `npm run test`
The test runner is Jest. Documentation on syntax is available [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect).
Per Jest standards, tests are in the `__tests__/` folder.

## Linting
You can lint your code with `npm run lint`
This uses AirBnB's defaults. Feel free to change this in the `.eslintrc.js` file

## Browser
Coming soon!
